# BetterMultitasking
iPadOS tweak to allow SplitView, SlideOver of any app (including iPhone-only apps)

This tweak enables splitview and slideover for every app on iPadOS.

Particularly, this allows you to run iPhone apps like Snapchat, instagram natively on iPad devices.

## Allow any apps to run in Slideover and SplitView

By default, iPadOS does not allow users to SplitView and Slideover certain apps that most certainly should be able to.
This tweak allows all apps to be a part of multitasking that normally can't be used in such a manner such as settings, cydia, netflix, and many games.

## Run iPhone apps natively on iPad

Instagram and snapchat are two heavily used social media apps that don't have iPad support. This tweak enables them to run natively on the iPad.
